Here are some snippets and examples of my code for the Connect 4 game and what it does.

1. Fields used to make Players and Board
    //Characters R and Y will represent the two players colors, Red and Yellow
    
    `private static final char[] PLAYERS = {'R', 'Y'};`
    
      //Dimensions of game board
    
      `private final int width;`
      
      `private final int height;`
    
      //grid of connect4 game board
    
      `private final char[][] map;`
      
2. Main method that plays the game

   `public static void main(String[] args)
    {`
    
    
        try (Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in))
        {
            //dimensions of game board
            int height = 6;
            int width = 8;
            int moves = height * width;`
            
            //creates board
            playConnect4 board = new playConnect4(width, height);
            
            //explains to user what to do
            System.out.println("Use 0-" + (width - 1) + " to choose a column.");
            //Displays blank board to user
            System.out.println(board);
            
            //switches players after each move, counting up until
            // maximum moves is reached or there is a winner
            for (int player = 0; moves-- > 0; player = 1 - player)
            {
                char symbol = PLAYERS[player];
                
                //asks the player to choose a col.
                board.choose(symbol, input);
                
                //prints out board with players new move
                System.out.println(board);
                
                //checks if player won, if not, players switch and game continues
                // if won, message is displayed.
                if (board.isWinningMove())
                {
                    System.out.println("\nPlayer " + symbol + " has won! Congrats!");
                    return;
                }
            }
            
            //prints out if maximum moves is reached and no winner.
            System.out.println("The game is over. No one is the winner. Play again?");
        }

    }
