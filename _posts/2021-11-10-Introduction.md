Hello! This is the documentation of a Connect 4 game written by Joseph Thomas in 2021.  
I decided to do my project on a Connect 4 game because it was always one of my favorite games to play growing up.

Connect 4 is a classic two-player game where players alternately place pieces at the top of a vertical board.  
The first player to connect four of their pieces either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally is deemed the winner.  
The code for this game was written in Eclipse and can be run on any terminal.
